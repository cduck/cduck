Hi, I'm an engineer, architect, and artist.  I currently build quantum computers at [QuEra Computing](https://www.quera.com/about) and in my free time, I create [computer-generated art](https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic#examples) and integrate [interactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming) into everything I make.

I open source my projects and tools for other to use in their artwork, education, and other projects.  Check them out below!


### Featured Python and Julia packages

#### Art
- [drawsvg](https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg) — Programmatically generate vector SVG drawings, animations, and interactive Jupyter widgets
- [hyperbolic](https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic) — Construct, draw, and manipulate [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry)
- [latextools](https://github.com/cduck/latextools) — Conveniently build, render, and convert Latex documents and figures
- [alime](https://github.com/cduck/alime) — Fancy animated anti-bot email obfuscation for your website
- [InteractiveAudio.jl](https://github.com/cduck/InteractiveAudio.jl) — Generate and play audio while dynamically changing the underlying code in real time

#### Quantum Computing

#### Education
- [block_sphere](https://github.com/cduck/bloch_sphere) — Visualize the [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) for intuition about quantum gates
- [feynman_path](https://github.com/cduck/feynman_path) — Visualize the [Feynman path sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation) of quantum circuits for intuition about quantum interference
