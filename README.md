Hi, I'm a [PhD student at the University of Chicago](https://caseyduckering.com/).
I study [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) and create [computer-generated art](https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic#examples) while integrating [interactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming) in everything I make.

As I make cool projects and tools that could be useful to others, I package, document, and maintain them here on GitHub for others to easily use for their own art or projects.  Check them out below.


### Featured Python and Julia packages

#### Art
- [drawSvg](https://github.com/cduck/drawSvg) — Programmatically generate vector SVG drawings, animations, and interactive Jupyter widgets
- [hyperbolic](https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic) — Construct, draw, and manipulate [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry)
- [latextools](https://github.com/cduck/latextools) — Conveniently build, render, and convert Latex documents and figures
- [alime](https://github.com/cduck/alime) — Fancy animated anti-bot email obfuscation for your website
- [InteractiveAudio.jl](https://github.com/cduck/InteractiveAudio.jl) — Generate and play audio while dynamically changing the underlying code in real time

#### Quantum Computing

- [feynman_path](https://github.com/cduck/feynman_path) — Visualize the [Feynman path integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation) of quantum circuits 
- [ChpSim.jl](https://github.com/cduck/ChpSim.jl) — Efficiently simulate quantum stabilizer (Clifford) circuits 
- [VLQ](https://github.com/cduck/VLQ) — Simple and fast [quantum error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction) architecture simulator
